## Frameworks + Libraries + Environments

- [Klangstrom](https://github.com/dennisppaul/klangstrom-arduino) "Klangstrom (KLST) is an infrastructure to facilitate generative, networked, embedded sound + music + composition. klangstrom is comprised of two software libraries ( klang a node+text-based sound synthesis library and strom a node+text-based generative composition library ), an embedded hardware platform, and a programming environment to allow seamless development of generative, networked, embedded sound + music + composition applications." #arduino #cpp
- [Wellen](https://github.com/dennisppaul/wellen) "wellen is a framework for exploring and teaching generative music making and algorithmic compositions. it facilitates simple ways of playing musical notes, facilitates easy access to low-level digital signal processing (DSP) and supplies rhythm and timing as well as some standard muscial mechanics. the library acts as an adapter to various sound in- + outputs like MIDI, OSC, or digital/analog audio." #processing #java
